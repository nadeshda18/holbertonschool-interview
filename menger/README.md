Menger Sponge

Requirements
General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
    All your files should end with a new line
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called menger.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded

Write a function that draws a 2D Menger Sponge

    Prototype: void menger(int level);
    Where level is the level of the Menger Sponge to draw
    If level is lower than 0, your function must do nothing
    You’re allowed to use the math library. Your program will be compiled using the ld flag -lm

Format:

    First, read Menger sponge
    Here, we will only draw a 2D version of the Menger sponge, but the principle is the same
    A level N sponge is a 3x3 square of level N-1 sponges, except for the center one, which is left empty
    A level 0 sponge is represented by the # character
    Examples:
        A level 0 sponge is a simple 1x1 square
        A level 1 sponge is a 3x3 square of level 0 sponges, except for the center one, which is left empty
        A level 2 sponge is a 3x3 square of level 1 sponges, except for the center one, which is left empty
        …
    TIP: The size of a level N Menger sponge is calculated as follows: 3^N
